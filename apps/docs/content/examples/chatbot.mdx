## Tutorial

Let's walk through how to build a chatbot using AI Elements and AI SDK. Our example will include reasoning, web search with citations, and a model picker.

### Setup

First, set up a new Next.js repo and cd into it by running the following command (make sure you choose to use Tailwind the project setup):

```package-install
npx create-next-app@latest ai-chatbot && cd ai-chatbot
```

Run the following command to install AI Elements. This will also set up shadcn/ui if you haven't already configured it:

```package-install
npx ai-elements@latest
```

Now, install the AI SDK dependencies:

```package-install
npm i ai @ai-sdk/react zod
```

In order to use the providers, let's configure an AI Gateway API key. Create a `.env.local` in your root directory and navigate [here](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%2Fapi-keys&title=Get%20your%20AI%20Gateway%20key) to create a token, then paste it in your `.env.local`.

We're now ready to start building our app!

### Client

In your `app/page.tsx`, replace the code with the file below.

Here, we use the `PromptInput` component with its compound components to build a rich input experience with file attachments, model picker, and action menu. The input component uses the new `PromptInputMessage` type for handling both text and file attachments.

The whole chat lives in a `Conversation`. We switch on `message.parts` and render the respective part within `Message`, `Reasoning`, and `Sources`. We also use `status` from `useChat` to stream reasoning tokens, as well as render `Loader`.

### Server

Create a new route handler `app/api/chat/route.ts` and paste in the following code. We're using `perplexity/sonar` for web search because by default the model returns search results. We also pass `sendSources` and `sendReasoning` to `toUIMessageStreamResponse` in order to receive as parts on the frontend. The handler now also accepts file attachments from the client.

```ts title="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { streamText, UIMessage, convertToModelMessages } from "ai";

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const {
    messages,
    model,
    webSearch,
  }: {
    messages: UIMessage[];
    model: string;
    webSearch: boolean;
  } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: webSearch ? "perplexity/sonar" : model,
    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),
    system:
      "You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks",
  });

  // send sources and reasoning back to the client
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse({
    sendSources: true,
    sendReasoning: true,
  });
}
```

You now have a working chatbot app with file attachment support! The chatbot can handle both text and file inputs through the action menu. Feel free to explore other components like [`Tool`](/components/tool) or [`Task`](/components/task) to extend your app, or view the other examples.

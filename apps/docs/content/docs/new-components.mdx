Want to add a new component to AI Elements? This guide covers what we look for and how to submit.

## Fit & Scope

Before building, consider whether the component:

### Solves an AI-Specific Need

Components should address challenges unique to AI interfaces:

- Chat and conversation UIs
- Streaming content display
- Model status and feedback
- AI-specific interactions (regenerate, branch, etc.)

### Doesn't Already Exist

Check if shadcn/ui or another library already provides what you need. AI Elements focuses on components that require AI-specific behavior.

### Has Broad Applicability

The component should be useful across different AI applications, not just your specific use case.

## Design Requirements

### Composability

Build components from smaller pieces:

```tsx title="example.tsx"
// Good: Composable
<Message from="assistant">
  <MessageContent>
    <MessageResponse>{text}</MessageResponse>
  </MessageContent>
</Message>

// Avoid: Monolithic
<Message from="assistant" content={text} />
```

### Consistency

Follow existing patterns in the library:

- Use `cn()` for class merging
- Extend HTML primitive attributes
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Match naming conventions

### Accessibility

Components must be:

- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader friendly
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Properly labeled

## Documentation Requirements

Every component needs:

1. **MDX documentation** with title and description
2. **Props table** documenting all props
3. **Usage examples** showing AI SDK integration
4. **Installation instructions**

## Technical Standards

### TypeScript

- Export all prop types
- Use proper generics where needed
- Avoid `any` types

### Testing

- Add unit tests for component logic
- Test accessibility with automated tools
- Verify behavior with AI SDK hooks

### Code Style

- Follow the project's Biome configuration
- Run `pnpm run check` before submitting
- Match existing component patterns

## Submission Process

1. **Open an issue first** - Describe the component and its use case. Get feedback before building.

2. **Build the component** - Follow the patterns in `packages/elements/src/`.

3. **Add examples** - Create examples in `packages/examples/src/`.

4. **Write documentation** - Add MDX docs in `apps/docs/content/components/`.

5. **Submit a PR** - Reference the original issue. Include screenshots or videos of the component in action.

## Review Process

Maintainers will review for:

- Alignment with library goals
- Code quality and patterns
- Documentation completeness
- Accessibility compliance
- AI SDK integration

Expect feedback and iteration. Quality components take time to get right.

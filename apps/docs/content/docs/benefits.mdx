AI Elements provides a purpose-built component library for AI applications. Here's why you should use it.

## Fully Composable

Every component is designed as a building block. Compose `Message`, `MessageContent`, and `MessageResponse` together to create exactly the chat UI you need. No rigid structures or forced layouts.

```tsx title="example.tsx"
<Message from="assistant">
  <MessageContent>
    <MessageResponse>{text}</MessageResponse>
  </MessageContent>
</Message>
```

## More Than Just Styled Components

AI Elements integrates deeply with the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/). Components understand streaming responses, handle loading states, and work seamlessly with hooks like `useChat` and `useCompletion`.

- **Streaming support** - Components like `MessageResponse` handle partial markdown gracefully
- **Status awareness** - UI adapts to pending, streaming, and complete states
- **Type safety** - Props align with AI SDK types like `UIMessage`

## Intuitive & Developer-Friendly

If you know React and TypeScript, you already know AI Elements. Components follow familiar patterns:

- Standard React props with TypeScript types
- Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- Full control when you need it

## Accessible & Themeable

Built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), AI Elements inherits:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility baseline
- **CSS variables** for easy theming
- **Dark mode** support built-in
- **Semantic HTML** throughout

Your existing shadcn/ui theme applies automatically.

## Fast, Flexible Installation

Install only what you need. The CLI adds components directly to your codebase:

```package-install
npx ai-elements@latest add message
```

- No hidden dependencies
- Full source code access
- Modify components freely
- Tree-shaking friendly

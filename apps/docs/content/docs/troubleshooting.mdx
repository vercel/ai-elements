## Why are my components not styled?

Make sure your project is configured correctly for shadcn/ui in Tailwind 4 - this means having a `globals.css` file that imports Tailwind and includes the shadcn/ui base styles.

## I ran the AI Elements CLI but nothing was added to my project

Double-check that:

- Your current working directory is the root of your project (where `package.json` lives).
- Your components.json file (if using shadcn-style config) is set up correctly.
- You’re using the latest version of the AI Elements CLI:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx ai-elements@latest
```

If all else fails, feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/ai-elements/issues).

## Theme switching doesn’t work — my app stays in light mode

Ensure your app is using the same data-theme system that shadcn/ui and AI Elements expect. The default implementation toggles a data-theme attribute on the `<html>` element. Make sure your tailwind.config.js is using class or data- selectors accordingly:

## The component imports fail with “module not found”

Check the file exists. If it does, make sure your `tsconfig.json` has a proper paths alias for `@/` i.e.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## My AI coding assistant can't access AI Elements components

1. Verify your config file syntax is valid JSON.
2. Check that the file path is correct for your AI tool.
3. Restart your coding assistant after making changes.
4. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

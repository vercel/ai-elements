This guide walks you through setting up AI Elements in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before installing AI Elements, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **React** 19
- **Next.js** 14+ (App Router recommended)
- **AI SDK** installed and configured
- **shadcn/ui** initialized in your project
- **Tailwind CSS** 4

<Callout>
  If you don't have shadcn/ui installed, running any AI Elements install command
  will automatically set it up for you.
</Callout>

## AI Gateway (Recommended)

We recommend using [AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) for model access as it offers a single API key for multiple model providers, built-in fallback support, unified billing and more.

Add `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` to your `.env.local` file. [Get your API key here](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%2Fapi-keys&title=Get%20your%20AI%20Gateway%20key).

## Installing Components

Use the AI Elements CLI to add components:

```package-install
npx ai-elements@latest add message
```

Or use the shadcn CLI:

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add @ai-elements/message
```

Components are added to `@/components/ai-elements/` by default.

## Verify Installation

After installing a component, verify it works:

1. Check that the component file exists in your components directory
2. Import and use it in a page:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import {
  Message,
  MessageContent,
  MessageResponse,
} from "@/components/ai-elements/message";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Message from="assistant">
      <MessageContent>
        <MessageResponse>Hello, world!</MessageResponse>
      </MessageContent>
    </Message>
  );
}
```

3. Run your development server and confirm the component renders

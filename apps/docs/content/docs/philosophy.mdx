AI Elements is built on core principles that shape every component and decision.

## Composability

Components are building blocks, not black boxes. You combine small, focused pieces to create exactly what you need.

```tsx title="example.tsx"
<Message from="assistant">
  <MessageContent>
    <MessageResponse>{text}</MessageResponse>
  </MessageContent>
  <MessageActions>
    <MessageAction label="Copy" onClick={handleCopy}>
      <CopyIcon />
    </MessageAction>
  </MessageActions>
</Message>
```

This approach gives you:

- **Flexibility** - Add, remove, or rearrange pieces
- **Control** - Style and configure each part independently
- **Clarity** - Understand exactly what renders

## Simplicity

Do one thing well. Components have a clear purpose and minimal API surface. We avoid:

- Unnecessary props and options
- Complex configuration objects
- Hidden behavior

When in doubt, we leave it out. You can always extend components in your codebase.

## Accessibility

Every component follows accessibility best practices:

- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Sufficient color contrast

Accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's built into component architecture from the start.

## Performance

Components are optimized for real-world AI applications:

- Minimal re-renders during streaming
- Efficient DOM updates
- Tree-shakeable exports
- No runtime CSS-in-JS

## Developer Experience

Building AI interfaces should feel natural:

- **Familiar patterns** - Standard React props and hooks
- **TypeScript first** - Full type safety and autocomplete
- **Good defaults** - Works out of the box
- **Full control** - Customize when needed

## AI SDK Alignment

Components integrate deeply with the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/):

- Props match AI SDK types
- Hooks work seamlessly
- Streaming behavior is handled correctly
- Status states are built-in

## shadcn/ui Foundation

AI Elements builds on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) conventions:

- Components live in your codebase
- CSS variables for theming
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Copy-paste friendly

Your existing shadcn/ui setup and theme apply automatically.

## Open Source

AI Elements is open source and community-driven:

- Transparent development
- Community contributions welcome
- No vendor lock-in
- Apache 2.0 license

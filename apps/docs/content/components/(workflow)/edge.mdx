The `Edge` component provides two pre-styled edge types for React Flow canvases: `Temporary` for dashed temporary connections and `Animated` for connections with animated indicators.

<Callout>
  The Edge component is designed to be used with the
  [Canvas](/components/canvas) component. See the [Workflow](/examples/workflow)
  demo for a full example.
</Callout>

## Installation

<ElementsInstaller path="edge" />

## Features

- Two distinct edge types: Temporary and Animated
- Temporary edges use dashed lines with ring color
- Animated edges include a moving circle indicator
- Automatic handle position calculation
- Smart offset calculation based on handle type and position
- Uses Bezier curves for smooth, natural-looking connections
- Fully compatible with React Flow's edge system
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript

## Edge Types

### `Edge.Temporary`

A dashed edge style for temporary or preview connections. Uses a simple Bezier path with a dashed stroke pattern.

### `Edge.Animated`

A solid edge with an animated circle that moves along the path. The animation repeats indefinitely with a 2-second duration, providing visual feedback for active connections.

## Props

Both edge types accept standard React Flow `EdgeProps`:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    id: {
      description: "Unique identifier for the edge.",
      type: "string",
    },
    source: {
      description: "ID of the source node.",
      type: "string",
    },
    target: {

      type: "string",
    },
